This page is a collection of the projects and labs I completed through the University of Oregon CIT Minor Upper-Division Classes

## CIT 281

### Project 1:
- Gained experience working with CLI, CLI commands, VSCode, and writing and executing non-server Node.js JS code
- [Code](https://github.com/lucasvandermark/cit281-p1)

### Project 2:
- Practiced using git via CLI and VSCode Source Control, gained experience writing and executing non-serve Node.js JS code, and practiced refactoring JS code
- [Code](https://github.com/lucasvandermark/cit281-p2)

### Project 3:
- Made a "coinage" code module that had the capability of calculating the total value of varying coin objects. This code was then pushed to a Node.js "server" using Fastify. The server page displays the initial web page, with functioning links to test the coinage module. 
- [Code](https://github.com/lucasvandermark/cit281-p3)

### Project 4:
- Created a REST API that works with question and answer objects using a code module, and used provided testing code to test the module. From here, I created a Node.js REST API to handle the GET verb. 
- [Code](https://github.com/lucasvandermark/cit281-p4)

### Project 5:
- Created a Monster Game program using class. This class created monsters with initial life values and minimum life values which the monster must keep to stay alive. After the program starts, each monster's life will drain by a random amount, and the game will end when all monsters have died. Each drain includes a built-in delay. 
- [Code](https://github.com/lucasvandermark/cit281-p5)

### Project 6:
- This project was not completed, but is being included for a complete record of the course assignments
- [Code](https://github.com/lucasvandermark/cit281-p6)

#

### Lab 1:
- Installed all software necessary for the course, practiced using said software, practiced keyboard shortcuts, and created my first Node.js server-side JS file
- [Code](https://github.com/lucasvandermark/cit281-lab1)

### Lab 2:
- Practiced CLI commands, created, added, and committed git files including using wildcards, learned to use .gitignore files, and cloned repos locally
- [Code](https://github.com/lucasvandermark/cit281-lab2)

### Lab 3:
- Practiced JS refactoring, object destructuring, converting normal functions into arrow functions, using for...in and for...of syntax, creating and importing Node.js compatible code modules, and examined code using the spread operator
- [Code](https://github.com/lucasvandermark/cit281-lab3)

### Lab 4:
- Created a Fastify Node.js web server, initialized the folder using Node Package Manager (npm), learned to exclude files that should not be tracked with .gitignore, and learned about MIME types
- [Code](https://github.com/lucasvandermark/cit281-lab4)

### Lab 5:
- Worked with Postman to handle Fastify server applications with GET and respond with JSON, and adapted the code to handle arrays as well as POST handling
- [Code](https://github.com/lucasvandermark/cit281-lab5)

### Lab 6:
- Joined GitHub and learned how to create classes in JS
- [Code](https://github.com/lucasvandermark/cit281-lab6)

### Lab 7:
- Created my own personal GitHub Website using GitHub Pages, and then cloned files to my local system, updated them, and committed them to my GitHub page
- [Code](https://github.com/lucasvandermark/cit281-lab7)

### Lab 8:
- Using JSONPlaceholder objects, created a Fastify server that fetched information and handled returned Promises with .then chain methods and .catch() chain methods
- [Code](https://github.com/lucasvandermark/cit281-lab8)

### Lab 9:
- Worked through the GitHub Learning Lab to create a release based workflow
- [Code](https://github.com/lucasvandermark/cit281-lab9)
